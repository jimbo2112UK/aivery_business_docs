## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash
- **Document Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **RAG Pipeline**: Custom Python scripts with sentence-transformers
- **Linting**: markdownlint, GitHub Super-Linter

## Request for Contributions

Contributors are invited to help with the following areas:

1. Creating new document templates following the established format
2. Enhancing the RAG capabilities with better embedding and retrieval
3. Improving automation and validation
4. Expanding international support for key jurisdictions

See the `NEXT_STEPS.md` file for instructions on how to contribute.

## Implementation Details

### Document Management

Each document in the repository follows a standardized structure with:
- YAML frontmatter containing metadata (title, domain, legal status, jurisdiction)
- Purpose section explaining the document's function
- Template content formatted for easy copying and customization
- Compliance notes for UK legal requirements
- Jurisdiction variants for international adaptation

The documents are stored in domain-specific directories matching Aivery's business structure, making it easy to navigate and maintain.

### RAG Implementation

The RAG system provides:
- Document chunking and indexing for semantic search
- Metadata extraction for filtering capabilities
- Simple search interface with scoring based on relevance
- Foundation for question-answering capabilities

The implementation allows both technical and non-technical users to quickly find relevant documentation through keyword search.

## Action Items for Next Sprint

1. Create templates for high-priority documents:
   - [ ] Shareholder Agreements
   - [ ] Service Agreements
   - [ ] Data Processing Agreements
   - [ ] Terms of Service & Privacy Policies

2. Improve RAG capabilities:
   - [ ] Add embedding generation with sentence-transformers
   - [ ] Enhance search interface with filtering options
   - [ ] Implement question answering with context retrieval

3. Update automation tools:
   - [ ] Enhance document health checks
   - [ ] Improve document creation script with more templates
   - [ ] Add validation for YAML frontmatter 

## Collaboration Plan

### Team Structure
- Technical Lead: Responsible for RAG implementation and automation
- Legal SME: Provides expertise on document compliance and legal requirements
- Content Creators: Draft and review document templates
- International Advisors: Support adaptation for different jurisdictions

### Workflow
1. **Planning**: Identify priority documents based on business needs
2. **Creation**: Draft templates following the standardized format
3. **Review**: Legal review for compliance and accuracy
4. **Integration**: Add to repository with proper metadata
5. **Testing**: Verify RAG functionality with new content
6. **Release**: Make available to end users

### KPIs
- Number of completed document templates
- Document coverage across domains
- RAG retrieval accuracy
- User satisfaction with document findability
