# Aivery Documentation Project Status

## Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for Aivery's business documentation, designed to be flexible, maintainable, and integrated with our broader GitHub ecosystem.

## Current Progress
- **Repository Structure**: Established basic directory structure with docs/, scripts/, rag/, and tasks/ directories
- **Documentation Templates**: Created standardized document templates with YAML frontmatter for metadata
- **RAG Capabilities**: Implemented initial RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) search functionality
- **Automation**: Developed scripts for document creation and maintenance

## Tools & Scripts
- **Document Creation**: `scripts/create-document.sh` - Generates new documentation files with proper formatting
- **RAG Search**: `rag/scripts/search.py` - Provides search capabilities across documentation
- **Status Checking**: Basic workflow for validating documentation status

## Recent Updates
- Enhanced README.md with clearer instructions for contributors
- Created NEXT_STEPS.md to guide new contributors
- Added PROJECT_STATUS.md (this file) to track overall project status

## Upcoming Work
- Further enhance RAG capabilities with better embedding models
- Improve documentation templates with additional metadata
- Develop more comprehensive contribution guidelines
- Create better integration with potential code repositories
- Implement automated testing for documentation validity

## Integration Strategy
The documentation repository is designed to integrate well with code repositories through:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Clear cross-referencing capabilities
- Flexible directory structure that can mirror code organization
- Metadata that enables automated processing

## Technical Debt
- Some scripts require additional error handling
- Documentation coverage is still developing
- Search capabilities need refinement

   - Data Processing Agreements (DPAs)

2. ðŸ”² Enhance RAG capabilities
   - Implement proper embedding generation
   - Create a more sophisticated retrieval interface
   - Add support for question answering

3. ðŸ”² Improve automation
   - Automatic document status updates
   - Integration with legal review workflows
   - Document validation checks

4. ðŸ”² Expand international support
   - Create jurisdiction-specific variants for key documents
   - Implement translation pipeline
   - Add compliance checklists for each jurisdiction

## Current Project Status

The project has established a solid foundation with the core infrastructure in place. The next phase should focus on populating the repository with the priority documents and enhancing the RAG capabilities.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Bash
- **Document Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **RAG Pipeline**: Custom Python scripts with sentence-transformers
- **Linting**: markdownlint, GitHub Super-Linter

## Request for Contributions

Contributors are invited to help with the following areas:

1. Creating new document templates following the established format
2. Enhancing the RAG capabilities with better embedding and retrieval
3. Improving automation and validation
4. Expanding international support for key jurisdictions

See the `NEXT_STEPS.md` file for instructions on how to contribute.

## Implementation Details

### Document Management

Each document in the repository follows a standardized structure with:
- YAML frontmatter containing metadata (title, domain, legal status, jurisdiction)
- Purpose section explaining the document's function
- Template content formatted for easy copying and customization
- Compliance notes for UK legal requirements
- Jurisdiction variants for international adaptation

The documents are stored in domain-specific directories matching Aivery's business structure, making it easy to navigate and maintain.

### RAG Implementation

The RAG system provides:
- Document chunking and indexing for semantic search
- Metadata extraction for filtering capabilities
- Simple search interface with scoring based on relevance
- Foundation for question-answering capabilities

The implementation allows both technical and non-technical users to quickly find relevant documentation through keyword search.

## Action Items for Next Sprint

1. Create templates for high-priority documents:
   - [ ] Shareholder Agreements
   - [ ] Service Agreements
   - [ ] Data Processing Agreements
   - [ ] Terms of Service & Privacy Policies

2. Improve RAG capabilities:
   - [ ] Add embedding generation with sentence-transformers
   - [ ] Enhance search interface with filtering options
   - [ ] Implement question answering with context retrieval

3. Update automation tools:
   - [ ] Enhance document health checks
   - [ ] Improve document creation script with more templates
   - [ ] Add validation for YAML frontmatter 

## Collaboration Plan

### Team Structure
- Technical Lead: Responsible for RAG implementation and automation
