## Design & Presentation Guidelines

1. **Visual Consistency**: 
   - Use consistent colors that match Aivery's brand identity
   - Use only 2-3 fonts throughout (one for headers, one for body text)
   - Include the company logo on every slide

2. **Content Guidelines**:
   - Keep text minimal (3-5 bullet points per slide maximum)
   - Use visualizations whenever possible (charts, diagrams, product screenshots)
   - Ensure all numbers and metrics are accurate and up-to-date
   - Focus on storytelling that flows logically from problem to solution to opportunity

3. **Presentation Tips**:
   - The deck should work both as a standalone document and as a presentation guide
   - Practice the pitch to keep it under 20 minutes
   - Be prepared with additional slides or materials for detailed Q&A topics
   - Tailor specific slides for different investor audiences (e.g., angels vs. VCs)

## Compliance Notes

- **Accuracy Requirement**: All information, particularly financial projections and market data, must be accurate and supportable. Misleading information could lead to legal liability.
- **Financial Projections Disclaimer**: Financial projections should include appropriate disclaimers about forward-looking statements.
- **Confidentiality**: Include a confidentiality notice on the cover and consider using watermarks for sensitive versions.
- **Regulatory Considerations**: Ensure compliance with financial promotion rules under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 when sharing investment materials.
