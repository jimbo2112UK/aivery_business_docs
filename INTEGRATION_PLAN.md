# Aivery Documentation Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines how the Aivery documentation project will integrate with the broader GitHub ecosystem, including code repositories and other documentation systems. The goal is to establish a seamless, maintainable documentation approach that works alongside code repositories.

## Integration Principles

### Cross-Repository Structure
- Documentation will follow a modular structure that can be linked across repositories
- Use of relative links for cross-referencing between documentation files
- Consistent naming conventions across all repositories

### Documentation Alongside Code
- API documentation will be maintained close to the code it documents
- Business logic documentation will be maintained in this central repository
- Cross-references will be maintained between code and business documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Markdown Standards
- All documentation will use GitHub Flavored Markdown
- YAML frontmatter for metadata to enable automated processing
- Consistent header structure to enable automated table of contents generation

### Directory Structure
- Mirror code repository structure where appropriate
- Use of README.md files at each directory level to provide context
- Standardized image directories for visual assets

### Automation
- Integration with GitHub Actions for validation and deployment
- Automated link checking across repositories
- Version tagging to align documentation with software releases

## Search and Discovery

### RAG Implementation
- Ensure RAG capabilities work across the entire documentation ecosystem
- Index both code comments and standalone documentation
- Implement semantic search capabilities

### Taxonomy and Tagging
- Develop common tags for cross-repository use
- Maintain a central glossary of terms
- Use consistent categorization across all documentation

## Collaboration Model

### Review Process
- Documentation changes follow the same PR process as code changes
- Cross-team reviews for documentation that spans technical areas
- Automated checks for style and formatting consistency

### Contribution Guidelines
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md with specific guidance for documentation
- Templates for different types of documentation
- Style guide for consistent voice and terminology

## Migration and Evolution

### Phased Implementation
- Start with core documentation in this repository
- Gradually extend to code repositories
- Establish migration plans for legacy documentation

### Measurement and Feedback
- Track documentation usage and search queries
- Regular review of documentation effectiveness
- Process for incorporating user feedback

## Next Steps
1. Finalize documentation templates
2. Implement automation for cross-repository link validation
3. Develop contribution guidelines specific to documentation
4. Create initial taxonomy and tagging system
5. Set up metrics for documentation usage and effectiveness
